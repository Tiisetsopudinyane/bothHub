      These sample questions are intended to provide an overview of the style,
      wording, and difficulty of the questions that you are likely to experience
      on this exam. These questions are not the same as what you will see on the
      exam nor is this document illustrative of the length of the exam or its
      complexity (e.g., you may see additional question types, multiple case
      studies, and possibly labs). These questions are examples only to provide
      insight into what to expect on the exam and help you determine if
      additional preparation is required
